# FEM Fatale

Hello TAs

We implemented i/o, forward Euler, force calculations, and collisions with a plane for FEM.

Our cube is inverting on itself because there's something wrong with our force calculations. We're hoping to get some feedback on this component of our code. Please check in FEMSolver.h for force calculations.

Thanks!

Anantha, Zach, Marissa, and Connie :)
